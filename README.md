# freeflow_flutter

A Flutter package to help you build server-driven UIs in your apps.

This package provides a set of tools to help you build server-driven UIs in your Flutter app. It allows you to define a schema for your app's UI and then fetch the actual UI from a server.

## How to use it?
This package is designed to work with the [freeflow-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/freeflow-ui) package for Node.js. It will fetch the UI schema from the server and then render it in your Flutter app.
You can refer to the example [here](https://github.com/FreeFlowUI/flutter_example).
